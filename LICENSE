MatrosDMS – Technology Study License
===================================

Copyright (c) YEAR MatrosDMS

This project is primarily developed as a technology study and reference
implementation. Its goal is to explore and demonstrate modern approaches
to document management systems, including architecture, data processing,
search, and automation.

The software is made available under a dual-licensing model

Intent and Philosophy
---------------------

MatrosDMS is published openly to encourage learning, experimentation,
discussion, and collaboration. The AGPL is used to ensure that improvements
to the software—especially in networked environments—remain accessible
to the community.

The commercial license exists to enable sustainable development and to
support use cases where open-source reciprocity is not feasible.

This project is not positioned as a drop-in enterprise product, but as a
transparent and opinionated technology study.
